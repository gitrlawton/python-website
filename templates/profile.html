<!-- Create a block here that extends the html page you want to copy the   -->
<!-- structure from, and add inside the unique content that you'd like     -->
<!-- to override the other page's content block with. That way, when you   -->
<!-- visit profile.html, the page will display "This is the profile page!" -->
